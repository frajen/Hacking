---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


				SPELL FLAGS


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Physical Damage			Check for physical damage (magical otherwise). This will cause
					the attack to respect the blind status if you have the evasion
					bugfix patch applied.

	Spell Miss If Death Prot.	Use this flag instead of "Miss if Prot. From Ailments" for any
					attack which sets the "death" status since the latter cannot
					prevent instant-death attacks from missing.

					NOTE: vanilla uses this flag for fractional damage attacks to
					prevent them from hitting bosses; Brave New World repurposes the
					"can't be suplexed" flag for this purpose instead.

	Target Only Dead Allies		Self-explanatory; used by Life spells

	Inv. Damage / Cure For Undead	Check to toggle "heal" flag (see below) on undead targets

	Randomize Target		Only used with Warp (?)

	Ignore Target's Defense		Attack will ignore damage reduction from (m)defense, safe/shell,
					row, defend, and morph. Aside from the obvious, this should be
					set for all curative as well as fixed-damage spells/abilities.

					Fractional damage attacks do NOT need this flag

					Note for ASM hackers: this flag does not play nicely with damage
					multipliers. As an example, Umaro throwing Mog was intended to
					auto-crit, but doesn't because throwing allies ignores defense.

	No Split Damage			Check to do full damage/healing on more than one target (will be
					halved otherwise). This setting will apply regardless of whether
					or not the spell forcibly targets multiple allies/enemies.

	Abort On Allies, Cost MP	Used for summon attacks, Flash/Bio Blaster, desperation attacks,
					and Interceptor. No clue whether or not it actually works.

	Heal				Self-explanatory. Remember to also set "ignores defense" flag;
					these two flags in conjunction will cause the attack to ignore
					"friendly fire" damage reduction (50%).

	Redirection			This is the "absorb" flag. Absorbs HP by default, or MP with the
					"concerns MP" flag set (for HP+MP, use the "Empowerer" special
					effect discussed earlier). Note that you can't damage more HP/MP
					than you're currently missing.

	Lift Status			Causes all of checked status(es) to be removed instead of set.
					Used (obviously) by Remedy, and Life spells must use this with
					the "death" status.

	Toggle Status			Self-explanatory; used by the Imp spell

	Stam. Involved in Def.		Flags the attack to consider the target's stamina (Stam/128) as
					an extra evasion check in addition to the normal success check.
					Do NOT use this flag with "can't be dodged"; for an attack that
					otherwise ignores evasion, set the accuracy to 255.

					Brave New World changes this flag to run a stamina check ONLY to
					determine if the flagged status(es) are set, whereas the damage
					portion will just use the regular hitrate. If the attack's power
					is 0 or if it's a fractional and/or redirectional (absorb HP/MP)
					attack, then it will miss entirely if the stamina check	passes;
					set the accuracy to 255 in this case for it to only check the
					target's stamina and ignore evasion.

	Can't Be Dodged			Makes attack unblockable. This flag overrides the hitrate, which
					can be set to 0. This should be used with all curative spells.

					Do not use with the stamina flag (above) or for any attack that
					should respect the blind status. Note: vanilla's behavior with
					the blind status is to cut the hitrate in half; Brave New World
					sets the hitrate to a flat 50%, which is necessary to allow for
					it to affect attacks the otherwise can't miss (accuracy = 255).

	Hits Mult, if Success %		Stupid scrubby Lv."X" Spell flag

					Brave New World repurposes this flag into an "abort on enemies"
					flag for things that are problematic if made to target the enemy
					(Mantra/Chakra,	Float, Palidor, Golem...)

	Factor=Power			Fractional damage/healing; power should be 1-16 (out of 16)

					Note that, unlike items, this flag concerns the target's CURRENT
					HP rather than their maximum unless the target's current HP = 0
					(i.e. Life spells). If you wish to make a "full heal" ability,
					it's best to hack an unused special effect to do 9,999 damage.

	Miss If Prot. From Ailments	Makes the attack miss if target has immunity to all statuses and
					elements(?) flagged on the attack. Note: This flag ONLY prevents
					the attack from dealing damage; it will still attempt to set any
					statuses (which is why is doesn't work for death). For attacks
					that deal no damage, the only function of this flag is to allow
					them to miss on immune targets (thus informing the player of the
					fact) rather than being invisibly ineffective.

	If hits, text		 	Self-explanatory

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


				TARGETING FLAGS


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Cursor Movable			Check for single or free-targeting spells

	One Side Only			Check for all multi-target spells, otherwise check only to stop
					single or free-targeting spells from targeting the other team

					(NOTE: check only this flag for a self-targeting spell)

					(ALSO NOTE: this flag is likely the cause of the bug where Gau
					won't target allies in a side attack with spells that use it)

	Auto-Select Both Parties	Check for spells that target all allies/foes (NOT for "group"
					targeting, which won't hit both sides of a pincer/side attack)

					(NOTE: check only this flag for spells that target everyone)

	Auto-Select One Party		Check for all multi-target spells (all allies/foes and "group")

	Auto-Confirm			Used only by Blitzes and Bushidos (and is probably unnecessary)

	Manual Party Select		Check for everything except single-target spells

	Cursor Starts On Enemy		Check for spells that should target enemies by default (use in
					conjunction with "One Side Only" flag to disallow targeting the
					opposing team)

	Randomize Selection		Do not use this flag

	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Note that targeting flags do NOT affect weapons except when they are used as items since
	the targeting is inherited from the "Fight" command; it is recommended if you are using
	the "Heal On Strike" weapon effect (0xC) that you also use Synchysi's hack to allow such
	weapons to use their targeting to override that of the "Fight" command.

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The above is a full list of special effects available for spells and weapons; all of them
	are available (albeit unlabeled and likely buggy) for use with spells, while weapons can
	only use up to 0F without hacking. Note that weapons will lose any special effect present
	when attacking with a command other than "Fight" (i.e. "Jump", "Mug", or "Throw").

	Further notes on bugs with (or my personal commentary on) individual effects...

	...Anti-Human (0x04) does not work with the "ignores defense" flag if used on a spell.

	...Randomly Throw (0x08) only calls the "throw" animation when the effect procs against a
	floating enemy; it will do extra damage to grounded enemies, but will look the same as if
	the effect hadn't occurred (this is arguably not a bug, but I think it's weird).

	...Retort (0x3C) is hard-coded to spell index #86, so the effect will persist even if
	you attempt to unset it. Would recommend hacking it out, since it's a very buggy effect.

	...Suplex (0x30) does NOT halve damage as the FF3usME description says. The targeting of
	Suplex itself designates it as a multi-target attack (leaving the "no split damage" flag
	unchecked) while both the attack animation AND the special effect force single targeting.

	...Quake/Magnitude (0x25) will cause attacks to remove the "clear" status from floating
	targets, even though the attack itself will otherwise still miss.

	...Engulf (0x39) requires ALL characters to be hit in order to go to Gogo's Cave after
	the fight instead of back to the world map. This is an issue if any characters are dead
	(note that Brave New World makes you fight Zone Eater) since they can't be targeted.

	...Overcast (0x37) does not respect immunity to the "zombie" status.

	...Mind Blast (0x28) does not behave exactly like Quadra Slam for targeting. Rather, it
	runs a normal hit check first and THEN makes four hits at random in the pool of whatever
	failed the evasion check. The result is, statistically speaking, a less even distribution
	of effects than if each hit were to check evasion individually, but a guarantee that all
	four hits will land unless every target passes their evasion check. Bearing in mind the
	latter, this approach somewhat diminishes the value of evasion to mitigate problems.

	...N.Cross (0x29) is an attempt by the developers to prevent your entire party from being
	frozen, except bad luck means that it can still happen and good luck means that nobody
	gets hit at all. This is a case where the "Mind Blast" approach would have worked better
	(using 2 or 3 hits instead of 4) to guarantee at least someone got it, but not everyone.
	It could still miss entirely if everyone passes their evasion check; otherwise, evasion
	will raise the likelihood of fewer characters being frozen due to having a smaller pool.

		(NOTE: all of the above-mentioned bugs/issues are fixed in Brave New World)

				FORMATION FLAGS


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	No Normal Attacks	Disallows standard encounters for the formation. This will override the
				Back Guard effect and is typically used alongside two of the other flags
				to force a specific setup for a scripted encounter (i.e. the Cranes).

	No Back Attacks		Self-explanitory/see above

	No Side Attacks		Self-explanitory/see above

	No Pincer Attacks	Self-explanitory/see above

	No Winning Stand	Set this flag and uncheck "play music" to allow the map's BGM to persist
				throughout the battle. This flag prevents the end-battle "victory dance"
				and subsequent music transitions, so checking it without unsetting "play
				music" will just result in silence after the fight ends.

	Hide Start Messages	Disallows pre-emtive attacks (...or just hides the message?)

	Can't Leap		Unused and unnecessary; use "Won't Appear On Veldt" flag instead

	Prevents Joker Doom	This will hard-prevent Slots from spinning 7-7-7, but NOT 7-7-Bar (which
				can be made to target opponents through confusion). This flag will cease
				to be effective if the symbols on Slots are rearranged and/or they are
				hacked to no longer be rigged.

	Won't Appear On Veldt	Formation will not appear on the Veldt if flagged. All formations up to
				511 are eligible to appear, but starting at 255 (presumably - 362 is the
				earliest confirmed instance) formations with no eligible monsters (index
				255 and below) will not appear even without this flag checked.

				To clarify, formations below 255 that appear on the Veldt can be leapt
				onto even if they contain ineligible enemies - they simply won't add any
				rages to his list; ProtoArmor and Allo Ver are examples of this.

	Can't Run w/ L+R	Do not use this flag

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	I'm afraid that's all we know, gentlemen.
