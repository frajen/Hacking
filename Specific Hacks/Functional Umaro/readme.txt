Final Fantasy 3 Controllable Umaro patch - beta version
by Master ZED (http://masterzed.web1000.com/)

*This patch was made only for version 1.0 of FF3*

Before I start off, in order for this patch to work correctly, you must have the cursor
option in Config set to Memory.  Otherwise all you'll be able to do is Umaro's throw.
Now then...

This is an unfinished but highly usable patch.  Umaro can now be controlled via the
command menu, with only Fight commands listed.  The four Fight commands are actually all
different, as follows:

1. Umaro's throw
2. Storm
3. Umaro's tackle
4. Fight

Storm you need not worry about aiming as it has the Randomize Target property.  His throw
will automatically pick a person to throw, just choose the target victim.  If there is
no one to throw, a normal tackle will be the result.

As for other potentially buggy situations, what has been compensated for is as follows:

Berserk
Muddle
Charm
Fanatic's Tower

For all of these cases, hacks are in place to revert Umaro to his old self under their
influence to prevent abnormal behavior, and in the tower's case, a freezing bug.  But by
old self I do mean how he usually behaves.  You will need the Rage Ring and Blizzard Orb
to get him to throw and use Storm while Berserk, for example, but not while he's in your
control.

For commands, the patch will change Umaro's startup command list to Fight x4, but if you
want your own save's Umaro changed, that's your problem.  You can try FF3h, made by
Lord J, in case you can't hack worth a damn on your own:

With that program you can hack your save RAM file (*.srm) to give Umaro his Fight
commands.  Not to say you couldn't give him anything else, but if you only give him one or
two Fight commands, what they will do depends on where you put them.

As for future plans, the only definite is to put in a text hack that will accurately
portray what each Fight command on Umaro's menu does.  But I'm bored now, so just use the
list I gave above.  Same order as the pointer table in the ROM.

Hell, for something I thought of while taking out the trash yesterday afternoon, you got
yourself one helluva hack already.  Now quit whining and get to tackling. :)
