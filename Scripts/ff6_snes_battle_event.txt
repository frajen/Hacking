WEDGE: Hey! What’s the matter? Do you know something we don’t……?

WEDGE: Where’s that light coming from?! Uwaaaaaaa!!!!
The frozen creature began emitting an eerie light……
Girl: …… …… ……
VICKS: Hey! Wedge……where are you? W……what’s happening?!
VICKS: Hold it! Think back to our briefing……
WEDGE: What about it?!
VICKS: Do you recall hearing about a monster that eats lightning……
WEDGE: ……and stores the energy in its shell!
VICKS: Right. So whatever you do, don’t attack the shell!
WEDGE: Alright already!
These are a little tight, but the price was right.
These are a little too big, but they’ll do.
LOCKE: Here we go!
Stole his clothing, too!!
Give it up, Vargas!
VARGAS: Is that you,  SABIN?!
SABIN: Vargas, why’d you do it? How could you do your own father in like that?!
VARGAS: Fool! He made the mistake of choosing you as his successor! He snubbed me, his only son!
SABIN: No! You were the one he chose!
VARGAS: You’re a liar!
SABIN: Our Master wanted you to be his successor, not me.  He appreciated your fine spirit……
VARGAS: Enough of your lies! Now, have a taste of my superior technique!
Mortal Attack! Blizzard Fist!
 VARGAS: Ahh, SABIN! The master taught you well!
SABIN: I guess there’s no avoiding this!
VARGAS: Fate made us train together, and fate will send you to your doom!
VARGAS: W……what the……?! He…… already taught you that?!
SABIN: If only you hadn’t been in such a rush for power……
KEFKA: Uwee, hee, hee! Good! Burn up everything!
SABIN: I guess we thrashed it.

TERRA: SABIN……!!!
BANON: Don’t worry about him!
EDGAR: Are you sure he’s okay, Banon?
BANON: You should know better than any of us! Any moment he’ll flop right onto the raft!
KEFKA: Yeouch!!
SABIN: Kefka! Wait!!!
KEFKA: “Wait,” he says…… Do I look like a waiter?
LOCKE: They seemed……angry.
