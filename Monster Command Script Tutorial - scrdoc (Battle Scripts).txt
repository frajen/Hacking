I. Before anything: What you'll need
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Hex Editor.
Don't have one? You can get A.X.E. at some random site.  It's free at least,
but you won't needanything too advanced for this at any rate so don't worry about getting
something that costs money unless you plan on going further.

A little knowledge of hexadecimal or a hex calculator.
This is the number system you'll be using, although you'll be using mainly just commands it
will help you to be a little familiar with it or to have a hex calculator ready.  The Windows
Calculator has hex functions (go to View and select Scientific).  You will need it to calculate
where pointers lead to, but thankfully for the layman to hex that's the most important thing.
You may need the calculator later for stuff like elemental counters, but if you do enough of
those you'll eventually learn hex enough to add up to 15, or Fh, which for elemental counters
is all you need to know anyway.
Basically: you may need the hex calculator mainly for pointers, but not much else.

A spell, item, and command list.
These are at the end of this doc.  You basically need these to set attacks up.
Reader's response: DUH! :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Purpose
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this doc is to teach you how to write/modify the monster's command scripts
in "Everyone's fav RPG for your SNES," Final Fantasy 3/6j.  I would've left it at notes,
but eventually I felt a tutorial was needed for this (more like "kindly alerted to the fact").
The stupid things have their own order and stuff, so it's like learning a very simple
programming language meant for babies.  It may have been a total ^@#$! to decypher for others
and myself over the course of about over a year and a half, but for you it will take all
of probably 20 minutes to know how to write Atma better than Square could have ever prayed for.

Good luck, you may need it depending on your IQ. :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. How to Get Where You're Going in the ROM
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Short and sweet:

F8600h = beginning of enemy command script pointers.  2 bytes each.

These point to where in the huge script space alloted in the ROM the monster's script starts.

For EXAMPLE - at some random pointer address: 84 03

The address of the pointer itself isn't exactly important.  So exactly *where* does that
lead?  How can you tell where to go?

F8900h + 384h = F8C84h : where the monster's script begins!

Explanation:

F8900h - This is where the script area begins.  This is always added on to the pointer value.

384h - The pointer value.  It said 84 03 up there, right?  Well, that's because the SNES normally
reads values big end last, or big-endian.  Since 03 was last, it became 300h.  84h was added on
to that, so 300h + 84h = 384h.  It's a lousy explanation, yeah, but as long as you get what
I just said enough to correctly calculate a pointer you'll be fine. :)

F8C84h - the result of the calculation.  This is where you go to see your monster's command
script!

Got it now?  Good.  If ya don't, reread it, or e-mail me, or preferably post to the GameFAQs 
SNES FF3 Message board.  I'd much rather respond to something there than an e-mail because
then you may or may not have to wait on me for your answer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Writing a Guard
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guard has the simplest command script in the game, and that's also the first script written.
Let's take a look at it, shall we?

F0 EE EE EF FF FF

"So like, what is it?"

The simplest list in the game.  What you see before you can be divided into 3 parts:

F0 - tells the game the next 3 bytes are spells that it must choose 1 from and use, then move on.

EE EE EF - the 3 spells to choose from.  In case you're wondering, these are the spells
in Hex and English:

EE     | EE     | EF
-------------------------
Battle | Battle | Special

FF FF - ends the list.  There's always 2 of these commands in a script, I will explain why
                        there are 2 later.

That doesn't look too hard to write out, does it?  I hope not, 'cause we're moving along.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Items, Targeting, and Other Assorted Mush
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So now you know how typical spell casting is done.  So what if I wanted to use Potions
and stuff?  What if I wanted to Jump?  That's what this next section teaches.

First, the command for Items: F6h.  For example:

F6 00 F8 F8

This would allow you to use a Green Cherry.
Now, say you wanted to throw the Atma Weapon.  Guess how kind Square was to us:

F6 01 1C 1C

Notice the difference in the 2nd byte?  00h tells the game that the next two bytes are to
be used as items, anything over results in it being thrown.  Which item byte it chooses is
random.

Now if you used the 2 examples above alone, there may have been something you noticed wrong with
the Cherry.  Your monster may have used it on the player and not itself!  What gives!?
The reason for this is because F6 usually targets the enemy automatically, along with pretty
much every command out there.  So what was a Square programmer to do about this?

Force it into Targeting what he wanted, of course!

This beautiful command is F1h.  For example, let's get our Green Cherry working:

F1 36 F6 00 F8 F8

If you use that, the monster will use Green Cherry only on itself.  As you may have noticed,
the extra byte (36h) was the only parameter F1 required.  That's because Targeting is all it
does.  So what are all of the known Targeting values of this command?  I'm so glad you asked!

     0-15 = Actor to target (list of actors at the end of this doc)
     36 = Self
     37 = All allies, but not self (if N/A, all enemies)
     38 = All allies including oneself
     39 = Single ally
     3D = Wounded ally (if N/A, targets random ally)
     43 = All enemies
     44 = Single enemy
     47 = Depends on the attack
     48 = Character #1
     49 = Character #2
     4A = Character #3
     4B = Character #4

So now you know how to target stuff with items, throw things, and now we're going to learn how
to Jump!  No kidding, you remember the DragoonBoots?  You remember the command it gave you?

Well, monsters too can use some of these wonderful commands.
The key to them is through F4h.  Let's see an example:

F4 16 16 16

Very simple: F4 followed by 16h 3 times.  16h BTW is Jump.  F4 has 3 parameters and works
like F0.  Very simple.  But say you wanted to use Health.  That, I will tell you now, will
target the player, but the monster will not hit itself with it.  Remember the little command
we used for the Green Cherry?

If you immediately thought F1, you've got the hang of the simple commands!

Before we go on, however, three more commands you need to know:

FD, FE, and FF.

They all have two things in common, they all end F1's influence, and they're used as fillers.

FD is typically used in-between some commands and spells (like F0 D1 D7 DE FD EE for example
usage).

FE is used to end the influence of FC commands (explained in the next section) and also as
filler for commands like F0.
Example: F0 FE FE D1 FD
This makes an approximately 33.3% chance that the monster will use HyperDrive this turn.
If it chooses FE, it will do nothing this turn and FD will stall the monster before it can
continue.

FF ends command lists.  The first FF command used will end your monster's normal and special
attack list.  The 2nd FF will end the list entirely.  What do you put between FF commands?
Final attacks and counterattacks!  You will learn about those in the next section as well,
but it may help you understand FF a little to see an example now:

F0 EE EE EF FF FC 12 06 00 C0 14 FF

The F0 you're already familiar with.  You'll notice after it ends FFh is used.  After this
a final attack has been implemented.  Finals and counters only work AFTER the first FF.
Don't worry, if you forget that I'll be repeating it in the next section at least once.

[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[]
BUT TAKE NOTE NOW: The command used for boss deaths, F5h, typically looks like this:

F5 0C 01 FF

That FF is part of F5!  This can throw you off when reading the command scripts in pure hex
and has thrown me off at least twice resulting in major blunders, such as my mistake in reading
Umaro's Jump as a dummy command.  I read the FF in F5 and thought that's where the list ended.
This resulted in I missing the Magic counter entirely, where after 3 Magic attacks, a variable
would be equal to 3, resulting in Jump being triggered in the main list.
You'll learn all of this in due time, of course. :)
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[]

Now let's take a quick look at the rest of this, how to make a good list.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Why Does Vargas Only Die Against Pummel?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With knowledge of some basic commands, you can now learn the most complex, but most valuable
command: FCh, along with a few others.  This is a plethora of commands in 1, and has a 3 byte
parameter.

If you thought the rest of this tutorial was pretty basic, it was just a prep for this.

We'll start with a boss death from another command, however, then tie it into FC.
How does a boss achieve its death?  With F5.

Example: F5 0C 01 FF

Now if you just use the command, the monster will use it and die off.  This is where
you set it as a final attack.  The command is the *gasp* FC 12 command.

Example for Final: FC 12 00 00 F5 0C 01 FF

When the monster dies, it will die a boss death.  Simple enough, but you can't just put
this anywhere.  You must set finals and counters AFTER the first FF.

So let's go for a counter, shall we?

There are 6 counters known so far: command, magic spell, item, elemental, attack,
and everything.  Examples given for the counters in the same order:

FC 01 00 00 F6 01 01 01 - Counters Fight with a thrown MithrilKnife
FC 02 14 14 D1 D1 D1 D1 - Counters Ultima with 4 HyperDrive spells
FC 03 FB FB F5 0C 01 FF - Counters Green Cherry with a boss death
FC 04 01 00 F0 8B 13 14 - Counters Fire attacks with a random spell: Condemned, Meteor, Ultima
FC 05 00 00 EE EE EE EF - Counters any attack with 3 Battle commands and a Special attack
FC 10 00 00 EE EE EF E0 - Counters anything by the player with 2 Battle commands,
                          a Special attack, and Revenger.

*Review*

You have your counters, so let's see a sample of what a GOOD list for blah monster could
play like, using what we've learned:

F0 D1 D1 A0 FD EE FD F0 35 2F 8C FD F1 36 F6 00 EC EC FF FC 12 00 00 F5 0C 01 FF
FE FC 01 09 09 F6 01 1B 1B FE FC 04 02 00 17 F4 05 05 05 FF

Can't tell what this list does?  Lemme outline it for ya:

F0 D1 D1 A0 FD EE FD F0 35 2F 8C FD F1 36 F6 00 EC EC FF

The main attack script.
Random spell: HyperDrive / Quasar | Wait
Battle | Wait
Random spell: Life 3 / Cure 3 / Roulette | Wait
Target Self, Item: Ether | End main script

Begin Counters and Finals -

FC 12 00 00 F5 0C 01 FF FE

Final Attack: Boss death | End influence of FC

FC 01 09 09 F6 01 1B 1B FE

Counter Tools: Throw Ragnarok | End influence of FC

FC 04 02 00 17 F4 05 05 05 FF

Counter Ice-elemental attacks: Merton, Steal | End entire script

*End Review*

So why does Vargas die only against Pummel?
They used a spell counter and not a command counter.  Their brains were missing that day, huh?

Now, let's get to the remaining stuff.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Variables, Low HP attacks, and All the Rest.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rest, along with unknown stuff, is right here.  We'll begin with mathematical variables!

These are controlled by F8.  You may be asking yourself, "Why were these put in and what good
are they?" Good question.  Remember Umaro and his Jump counter I mentioned earlier in my F5
command Boss death warning?  F8 was used to determine if Magic had struck him 3 times.  Every
time Magic struck, the following script was used:

FC 01 02 02 F8 24 81 FE

F8 24 81 - Adds 1 to variable 24.
When variable 24 == 03, Jump would be invoked by this:

FC 0D 24 03 F4 16 16 16 F8 24 00 FE

FC 0D 24 03 - If variable 24 == 3...
F8 24 00 - Set variable 24 to 0.
F8 sets up variables.  Any value can be used as a variable (I assume so) and all variables are
started out at 0.  FC 0D checks a variable to see if it should initialize.
F8's two parameters are the variable ID and the operand w/ value respectively.  F8's operands
are as follows:

0? - Set variable to ?
8? - Add ? to variable
C? - Subtract ? from variable

It's not known if multiplication and division are there, but they really aren't needed as you
can only manipulate these with values ranging from 0 to 15 decimal (0-Fh).

Now, sometimes a monster will switch up attacks when they reach under a certain HP rating.
This is done with the FC command FC 06.  The 1st byte is used for who will be the target.  The
values for this are the same as F1, which means if Square wanted to they could have had a monster
scan for your HP rating and unleash a powerful move right when you don't need it!  However,
most of these if not all were used with 36, which is the value that targets the creature itself.
The 2nd byte is used for HP rating.  It's only 1 byte, but this byte's value is multiplied by
128 decimal (80h).  This means you can scan for going under or to 32640 HP or lower.

Example time!

FC 06 36 80 F0 CB CB 8B FE

This, when the monster goes down to or under 16384 HP, will trigger a random spell: Sneeze or
Condemned.  The switch may be a permanent one, as this comes in the main attack list before the
regular commands of a monster.

By this time you should pretty much get the order of FC, so I'll list all known functions
of FC:

     01 = Command Counterattack.
          Next two are what commands to counter.
     02 = Spell counter
          Next two bytes = the spell(s) to counter.
     03 = Item counter
          Next two are what items to counter.  
     04 = Elemental counter
          Byte 1:
          1st part: Fire, Ice, Lightning, Poison
          2nd part: Wind, Pearl, Earth, Water
          Byte 2 is unknown
     05 = Begin using attack(s) when damaged
          Healing and misses will not provoke this "counter."  Ailments untested.
          This can be used with other FC commands.  Next two unknown.
     06 = Low HP attack counter
          1st byte = who has HP rating, 2nd byte = Trigger at this HP rating or below it.
          HP rating is whatever you put in * 80h (128 decimal)
     0B = If 0F 00 follow up, means 3 turns have passed.
     0D = Byte 1 is the variable used, byte 2 is the value it must be equal to or greater
          than to activate.  The variables are set by F8.
     10 = Counterattack everything.  Next two unknown.
     12 = Final attack.
          Byte 1 = Which monsters in template must be dead to trigger, put 00 to ignore this.
          Byte 2 unused by any monsters, so it is unknown.
     13 = Attack(s) if # of monsters are left.
          Next two bytes = # of monsters left to activate (unknown if multiple #'s
          can be assigned)
     1A = Byte 1 is the target, Byte 2 is the element(s) the target is weak against to
          activate.

Now, the scheme of things:

1. Counters and Finals should be placed after the first FF command.
2. Low HP attacks are *typically* used before the first FF.
3. If you don't know how to use a command, the best way to find out is go by Square's examples!

At this point you should understand how to write your own list.  The next section will list
the remaining known commands so you know what they are and how to use them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. The Leftover Goodies
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

F2: Replacement template manipulator
3 byte parameter, byte 1 for method of death, 2 and 3 used as a template pointer.
Please refer to Kefka's goons for example usage.

F3: Text messages
2 byte parameter, both bytes used to point to text used.
Example: F3 4C 00
004C is CzarDragon's quote.  This example does not exist in the game, BTW.

F7: Battle Events
1 byte parameter, byte used to point to event used.

F9: Unknown at the current time
3 byte parameter, refer to ROM for example usage.

FA: Palette manipulation (glow effects and stuff)
3 byte parameter, refer to ROM for example usage.

FB: Think up your own stupid name for this one. :)
2 byte parameter, 1st byte determines action, byte 2 depends on byte 1.
Example: FB 01 36
01 = invincibility, 2nd byte = aiming in this example.  Used by Guardian.

Enemy Command list:

F0 = normal spells/attacks.  3 bytes.
F1 = forced aiming method
Has a set length of 1 byte. This effects everything that comes after it until
a filler F# command (usually FD). The scripts use a different set of aiming
numbers from anything else in the ROM.
F2 = replacement template assigner
Byte 1 = Way enemy dies
Bytes 2 & 3= Enemy template used
F3 = Message assigner
Usage = F3, next 2 bytes = message displayed.
F4 = Player Command controller
Set length of 3 bytes. Usage is same as with F0.
F5 = Enemy/Template manipulator
Set length of 3 bytes.
F6 = Item usage
If following byte == 00, item
If following byte > 00, throw
Set length of 3 bytes (1st saying Item or Throw, next two the items).
F7 = Event selector (Locke stealing clothes, Terra & Tritoch, etc.) 1 byte.
However, in some cases it will take aditional commands for this to work the way
you want it to (ex: FB to fade out after Terra & Tritoch scene, FC 01 05 05/06
to activate after successful theft.)
F8 = Variable manipulator
Used to create variables to trigger special attacks. All variables begin at 0.
Byte 1 = Variable I.D. (in theory, anything you want)
Byte 2 = what to do with it.
0? = Set variable to ?
8? = Add ? to variable
C? = Subtract ? from variable
F9 = ???
FA = Enemy graphics manipulator
Usage = FA, then value (ex: 0B makes enemy glow yellow, and certain bytes on the
palette change colors (used on Atma and possibly AtmaWeapon))
FB = Think up your own stupid name for this one. :)
Used after some events (Tritoch & Terra in WOB) and for Guardian. Has a set
length of 2 bytes.
1st byte = action
01: Invincibility.
2nd byte = ? (aiming byte if byte 1 == 01. Refer to F1 for values.)
FC = Special Circumstance Attacks
Set length of 3 bytes. The 1st byte tells FC what it will be doing, the next two
depend on what's been set by the 1st. FE typically ends the command's influence.
Commands range from 01 thru 1B.
1st byte:
01 = Command Counterattack.
Next two are what commands to counter.
02 = Spell counter
Counters a specific Magic/Blitz/Swdtech/etc.
Next two bytes = the spell(s) to counter.
03 = Item counter
Next two are what items to counter.
04 = Elemental counter Use this to counter a specific element.
Byte 1: 1st part: Fire, Ice, Lightning, Poison
        2nd part: Wind, Pearl, Earth, Water
Byte 2 is unknown
05 = Begin using attack(s) when damaged?
Healing and misses will not provoke this "counter." Ailments untested.
Next two bytes unknown.
0B = If 0F 00 follow up, means 3 turns have passed.
0D = Byte 1 is the variable used, byte 2 is the value it must be equal to or
greater than to activate. The variables are set by F8.
0F = ??? Byte 1 seems to be targeting, Byte 2 is unknown.
10 = Counterattack everything. Next two unknown.
12 = Final attack.
Byte 1 = Which monsters in template must be dead to trigger(?), 00 for none.
Byte 2 unknown.
13 = Attack(s) if # of monsters are left.
Next two bytes = # of monsters left to activate (unknown if multiple #'s can be
assigned)
14 = ??? Found in Vargas' list.
15 = Found at the beginning of Ultros #1's list.
1A = Byte 1 is the target, Byte 2 is the element(s) the target is weak against
to activate.
1B = ???
FD = no attack/filler, typically used to end a turn.
FE = no attack/filler, used in unused slots in lists, and doesn't go back for a
     list.
FF = no attack/filler, used at the ends of enemy command scripts. Main attacks
are set before this command is used once. After the first command, Counters and
Finals should/can be set. The 2nd FF will always end a list.

Cless -
For requesting my help in deciphering the scripts in the first place.
If it weren't for that, I would not have gotten as far as I did on this.

Bill - For the help with FC, *big* thanx for F8's functions.

Everyone at the GameFAQs SNES Final Fantasy 3 board -
For the conversations and the incredible amount of knowledge and new surprises
shared there.  I thought I knew everything when I began there in February 2000,
but now all of us are learning something new at least once a week on this game.

Three sites ZED felt you should visit someday:

One of the best message boards on FF3 out there.

Phantasian Productions -

Well, he did start me on the scripts, why not plug his ROM hacking site? :)
Home of the FF6 ROM Hacking doc and FF6 HardType.

The Unoriginal White Sheet -

My site, dedicated to FF3.  Lots of data here, some not found in Cless' doc.

The author of this tutorial.  You might get an answer from this geek.
No ROM requests, I despise them.  You'll get ignored *permanently* for that
crap.  I also hate rumors pertaining to FF3, post those to the FF3 board
mentioned above.
